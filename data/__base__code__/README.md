# About this namespace...
This '\_\_base_code\_\_' namespace is for showing the simplified/stripped-down code for making a double jump detection, without all the library slop (which is mainly for UX/ease of access)
If you wish to implement this system into your own datapack without using the library, the original code I developed can be found in this namespace. The main use is just for you to grab the general idea/logic and put it into your pack.

For a better UX and error handling, I recommend you use the 'doublejumplib' namespace. This is easier to work with and interface with.

Additionally, this also remains untested. Its a near copy-paste of my personal project's old double-jump detection (with just the namespace/file names and scoreboard objective names changed) but if it breaks then I'm very sorry, but I hope you can see my logic.
